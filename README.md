May need to allow apk to install from anywhere in your phone to work correctly and ignore warnings as this is just a test app.

## Commands
If **yarn** is not installed, **npm run** can be used instead.
### To run on android
    yarn android

### To run on ios
    yarn ios
### To start metro bundler
    yarn start
